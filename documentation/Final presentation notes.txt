- AdamW decoupled weight decay regularization
	-> Other specialized regularization for image segmentation (spatial regularization): see A Regularized Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Image Segmentation
	
- Accuracy loss in open meshes due to boundary preserving edge-collapsing. Handling of borders as in image CNN?

- Ambiguity: (cylinder can also be extrusion, revolution...). Show 2nd guess accuracy.
